New in 0.94:

* New option `--windows-compatibility' which adds two artificial blue zones
  at vertical positions given by `usWinAscent' and `usWinDescent'.  This
  helps ttfautohint's hinting algorithm reduce the possibility of clipping
  if those two values are very tight.

* Implement option `--x-height-snapping-exceptions', making ttfautohint
  avoid x-height snapping for selected PPEM values.  Useful in combination
  with `--windows-compatibility'.

* Minor fixes to the created bytecode for compatibility and robustness.


New in 0.93:

* New option `--components' to treat components of composite glyphs
  separately.  This greatly reduces the bytecode size.

  I'm waiting for reports whether this option works for most fonts; in case
  this is true I'm inverting the option, making it the default (and the old
  behaviour optional).

* Full support of TTCs, this is, all subfonts get auto-hinted now.

* The upper limit of the `--increase-x-height' option has been removed.

* Drag-and-drop support in the GUI.

* The TTY version of ttfautohint now acts like a (Unix) filter, this is, it
  accepts stdin and stdout as input and output, respectively.

* Less memory consumption.


New in 0.92:

* A serious bug in the created bytecode has been fixed, causing incorrect
  rounding.


New in 0.91:

* A new, `strong' routine to handle stem widths and positions has been
  added, to be selected with the `--strong-stem-width' command line option.
  If it is active, stem widths and positions are snapped to the grid as much
  as possible.  This algorithm is useful for GDI ClearType support.

* A new command line option `--debug' (not available for ttfautohintGUI) to
  print very detailed debugging information.


New in 0.9:

* The created bytecode has been reduced in size, making it approx. 20%
  smaller.

* New option `--symbol' to use standard stem height and width values instead
  of using character `o' (which may be missing).  Use this option for symbol
  fonts or math glyphs.

* More documentation (in text, HTML, and PDF format).  It's still
  incomplete, though.

* Option `--ignore-permissions' has been renamed to `--ignore-restrictions'.
  The short form is still `-i'.

* Defaults for various parameters have been set to more sensible values:

    hinting-range-max: 50 (was 1000)
    hinting-limit: 200 (was 1000)

* Option `--increase-x-height' now has a mandatory argument (in the range
  6-20 or value 0 to disable it, default value is 14).


New in 0.8:

* Implement option `-x' to increase the x height of the font for small PPEM
  values by rounding up far more often then rounding down.

* Add option `-G N' to switch off hinting completely above value N.

* ttfautohint now appends version information and the used parameters to the
  `Version' field(s) in the `name' table.  This can be suppressed with
  option `-n'.


New in 0.7:

* A GUI has been added, using the Qt framework.  The binary is called
  `ttfautohintGUI'.


New in 0.6.1:

* The improved handling of composite glyphs in 0.6 was buggy under certain
  circumstances, making ttfautohint crash and FontValidator complain.

* Dropout handling has been activated.


New in 0.6:

* Improved handling of composite glyphs.

* Implement option `-p' to pre-hint glyphs with original hints before
  conversion takes place.

* Don't add a DSIG table if there is none in the input font.

* Human-readable error messages instead of hexadecimal error codes.

* Better tests (both at runtime and compile time) to reject too old FreeType
  versions.


New in 0.5:

* Rendering on iOS is now expected to give good results.

* No bad rendering at very large PPEM values.


New in 0.4:

* The bytecode has been changed to `create' twilight points.  This should
  avoid rendering artifacts on some platforms.


New in 0.3:

* Fix font generation; sometimes the `glyf' table was one byte too short,
  making the font invalid.


New in 0.2:

* Fix bytecode bugs which prevented correct rendering on some platforms.


New in 0.1:

* First release.
